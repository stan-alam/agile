## notes on "Mob" programming
**Scrum helps prevent group thinking, Scrum is a synergistic effort ->
Developers + Testers + Documentation , it is not a
democracy as in the sense of mob rule.**

Build systems faster and more effectively with Mob Programming. Mob Programming
is an approach to developing software that radically reduces defects and key-person
dependencies by having a group of people work together at a single machine. See how
to avoid the most common pitfalls that teams make when first starting out. Discover
what it takes to create and support a successful mob. Now you can take collaborative
programming to the next level with Mob Programming.
Mob Programming is a natural extension of the popular Pair Programming concept, and is
not restricted to a specific programming language or technology. It can be used by anyone
who develops software, including dev leads, software developers, and agile coaches. The more
people working on a bug or feature results in fewer dependencies on individuals, and overall
increased learning for everyone involved. With more eyes on the code, youâ€™ll find you develop
better solutions with fewer defects.
Set up your team for success by introducing Mob Programming in a way that benefits them.
Create a good first Mobbing experience for your team with a template that avoids the common
traps beginners may fall into. Master a collaborative and empathic mindset to help optimize the
Mobbing experience. Learn how to make adjustments when things go wrong. Adapt your mobbing to
different types of development tasks. Get management buy-in for your Mobbing experiment by
demonstrating the benefits. Discover the equipment and resources you need, and how to adjust
your workspace for an effective mob.
Get important features to market sooner, squish bugs faster, and collaborate better today with
Mob Programming.
