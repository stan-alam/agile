## Notes on People Over Process

```text
This book helps participants in agile software development environments learn to become leaders.
Facilitative leaders should be at every level of the organization, from individual
contributor to informal team leader to managers of all stripes — it takes much focus
and intentionality from senior organizational leaders, who have special obligations in
creating successful lean and agile development environments. But, beyond the principles
of facilitative leadership for agility, People over Process provides tips and
demonstrative scenes for the more important and common software meetings: architecture
simulations, project planning, team configurations, retrospectives, and more.
The author fully illustrates the principles and shares proven techniques for
the most important leadership events in agile projects.
While this book focuses on facilitating extraordinarily well-prepared meetings,
it serves as a metaphor for leadership more broadly. The leader’s obligation to
help their team make rigorous fact-based decisions; to gain broad input and have
participants aligned on the outcomes and next steps; and to do so in an efficient way
that respects the time of the participants is as relevant to every-day leadership
activity as it is to conducting meetings.
The author mixes background and explanation with demonstration — in this case, the story
of an agile project at the fictitious Pacifica Bank. The scenario constructed at Pacifica
illustrates the concepts of effective leadership and productive workplace environments.
The book concentrates on the flow of software from understanding what is needed through
design, development, testing, and deployment.
Essentially, the author provides a simple and powerful model of leadership,
examples, and tips. This is not a cookbook on how to lead — It is a set of principles
and examples. All leaders must find their own way for their team, their organization, and their unique challenges.
