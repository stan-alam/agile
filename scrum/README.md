We live in a world that is broken. For those who believe that there must be a more
efficient way for people to get things done, here from Scrum pioneer Jeff Sutherland
is a brilliantly discursive, thought-provoking book about the management process that is
changing the way we live.

In the future, historians may look back on human progress and draw a sharp line designating
“beforeScrum” and “after Scrum.” Scrum is that ground-breaking. It already drives most of the
world’s top technology companies. And now it’s starting to spread to every domain where people
wrestle with complex projects.

If you’ve ever been startled by how fast the world is changing, Scrum is one of the reasons why.
Productivity gains of as much as 1200% have been recorded, and there’s no more lucid – or
compelling – explainer of Scrum and its bright promise than Jeff Sutherland, the man who put
together the first Scrum team more than twenty years ago.

The thorny problem Jeff began tackling back then boils down to this: people are spectacularly
bad at doing things quickly and efficiently. Best laid plans go up in smoke. Teams often work
at cross purposes to each other. And when the pressure rises, unhappiness soars. Drawing on his
experience as a West Point-educated fighter pilot, biometrics expert, early innovator of ATM
technology, and V.P. of engineering or CTO at eleven different technology companies, Jeff began
challenging those dysfunctional realities, looking for solutions that would have global impact.

In this book you’ll journey to Scrum’s front lines where Jeff’s system of deep accountability,
team interaction, and constant iterative improvement is, among other feats, bringing the FBI into
the 21st century, perfecting the design of an affordable 140 mile per hour/100 mile per gallon car,
helping NPR report fast-moving action in the Middle East, changing the way pharmacists interact with
patients, reducing poverty in the Third World, and even helping people plan their weddings and
accomplish weekend chores.
